ideas:
-enemy spawning: random spawn rate, random speed, more movement options (homing)
-make game harder the longer it takes, with cap -> log function
-different type of enemies: ones with bullets, explode after some time, fast ones, 
tanky ones
-buff items: time freeze, increase movement, invincibility, 
-IFrames after health lost


todo:
-win/lose condition: highscore, boss
-ship selection: different stats, movement, weapon (machine gun, shotgun, 
boomerang etc.)
-quit button in menu
-pause option with quit
-settings: simple sound setting
-sound
-visuals, sprites, animations
-bonus: parallax, sprite shader, rewind, assassins creed mechanic
