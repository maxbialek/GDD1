ideas:
-enemy spawning: random spawn rate, random speed, more movement options (homing)
-make game harder the longer it takes, with cap -> log function
-different type of enemies: ones with bullets, explode after some time, fast ones, 
tanky ones
-buff items: time freeze, increase movement, invincibility, 
-IFrames after health lost


todo:
-ship selection: weapon (machine gun, shotgun, boomerang etc.)
-settings: simple sound setting
-sound
-visuals, sprites, animations
-bonus: parallax, sprite shader, rewind, assassins creed mechanic
